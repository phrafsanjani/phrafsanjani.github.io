# Curated Resources: Books, Movies, Blogs and More!

## Books

I have always been an avid reader and a book lover. When I was younger, I primarily enjoyed fiction.
But nowadays, I cannot just read any book or any story. I have become too picky,
and I only opt for the very good stories when it comes to fiction!
Beyond that, my reading diet is varied, encompassing non-fiction and academic texts as well.

Here, Iâ€™ve decided to list my all-time favorite books.
You can also check out [my blog](/blog),
where I intend to track my reading journey.

## Movies and TV Series

You can find a list of movies and miniseries I've watched on [my Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/phrafsanjani/),
although I currently don't write reviews for screen media and just star them.
Unlike books, movies and TV series are my way of escapism and simply enjoying the experience.
