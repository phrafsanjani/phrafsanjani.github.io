## Books

I have always been an avid reader and a book lover.
When I was younger, I enjoyed fiction more than anything else.
However, I have now become too picky,
and I only opt for the very good stories when it comes to fiction!
While I am trying to get back to reading fiction,
most of my reading consists of non-fiction and scientific texts and papers.

### Favorites

Here, I’ve decided to list my all-time favorite books.
You can also check out [my blog](/blog),
where I intend to track my reading journey besides other stuff I write about.
