# About Me

\toc

## Parsa Hosseinipour Rafsanjani

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciences from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic),
with coursework and research spanning mathematics and computational methods.
During my studies, I was drawn to probability and statistics,
which led me to collaborate with Dr. Adel Mohammadpour on a research manuscript on mathematical statistics and a book on statistical inquiry.
My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics and molecular biology, with a focus on developing and analyzing computational tools for omics data.

In the next few sections, I share my academic focus along with some other nerdy and geeky interests!

## Formal Research Interests

### Statistics

I am passionate about both theoretical and applied statistics.
My research interests span computational biology, bioinformatics, and statistical applications in psychology, economics, and other social sciences.
Statistics in the language of data analysis and therefore a lot of sciences, which has its roots in mathematics, while encompassing a rich philosophy and sparking hot debates.
I find it interesting that such an important field which deals with uncertainty was born out of mathematics, a stronghold of certainty!
Imagine what a power it is to think and reason in such an impressive language, to be able to understand and evaluate studies done in different fields, or at least have a general idea about them.

### Computational Biology and Bioinformatics

Building on probability theory, statistical sciences also provide powerful tools to model and analyze natural phenomena.
My particular interest lies in applying statistical and computational methods to advance research in computational biology and bioinformatics.
I believe that helping improve people’s health and making a true difference through biological fields is a great purpose one can pursue.
That’s why I intend to formally work in the biomedical field, as it allows me to combine my passion for molecular and cell biology with the opportunity to contribute to medicine.

## Independent Studies

### Philosophy

My primary philosophical interest is Stoicism, particularly the works of Seneca.
However, I also enjoy studying other prominent Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus,
along with more modern thinkers.

In a letter to his friend Lucilius, Seneca proclaims philosophy's universal invitation:
> Philosophy neither rejects anyone nor chooses anyone; it shines
> for all. Socrates was no patrician; Cleanthes hauled water, and hired
> himself out to water people’s gardens; Plato did not come to philosophy
> a nobleman but was ennobled by it. Why should you not hope
> perhaps to become their equal? All of them are your ancestors if you
> prove yourself worthy of them. And you will do so if you persuade
> yourself, right now, that no one is superior to you merely by reason
> of noble birth.
― Lucius Annaeus Seneca, *Letters on Ethics*, Letter 44. Translated by Margaret Graver and A. A. Long. The University of Chicago Press, 2015.

In another letter, he writes:
> Would you like to know what philosophy has to oﬀer the human race? Advice!
― Lucius Annaeus Seneca, *Letters on Ethics*, Letter 48. Translated by Margaret Graver and A. A. Long. The University of Chicago Press, 2015.

His letters are filled with wisdom, and although they were written around two thousand years ago, I believe they remain relevant to modern human beings.
They have personally helped me navigate the pandemic and through sad and lonely times.
It is indeed a pleasure to have such a friend and mentor by your side, someone who can calm you with their words and help you grow, especially when many others, whose presence we feel, lack such capabilities.

### Psychology

My interest in psychology focuses specifically on close relationships, singlehood, and personality.
These are concepts I've deeply contemplated in my personal life, and I believe rigorous research in these areas is profoundly important.
I would like to follow some research on quantitative psychology at some point as well, as you might now understand why 🙂.

### Economics

Economics is another field I occasionally study.
We should all strive to be good decision-makers, and economic literacy, I believe, is key to this.
Economics isn't just about money and markets; it's a framework for life.
I believe that with economic knowledge, we can make better choices, from everyday decisions to major financial ones.
And of course, imagine how fascinating it is to be able to understand and follow econometric literature...

### Open-Source & GNU/Linux

Beyond academia, I'm a GNU/Linux enthusiast.
I began using GNU/Linux in 2020,
starting with Ubuntu before exploring other distributions like Fedora, Linux Mint, and Pop!\_OS.
Having used Pop!_OS as my primary OS for several years, I transitioned to Arch Linux and have experienced no major issues so far.

My main motivation was to deepen my understanding of Linux.
Arch has taught me what questions to ask when configuring my system for my workflow,
and how little is actually needed to perform my computations.
Unlike versioned distributions, Arch follows a rolling-release model (there’s just one Arch Linux, not Arch 1.0, Arch 2.0, etc.),
which I see as one of its greatest strengths.
The system is reliable, and thanks to excellent Arch and Arch-based forums, problems can usually be resolved quickly.

I also appreciate Arch’s philosophy:
it’s entirely free to use without restrictions, and users have full control on choosing free or proprietary software for their system.

More broadly, I’m deeply interested in exploring and supporting open-source software and communities.
Whenever possible, I try to minimize my reliance on large corporations.
While I don’t oppose using well-made proprietary tools, I actively evaluate tech trends and company practices before deciding which ones to use.

## Social Media and Online Activity

I generally try to avoid social media.
I have no interest nor any reason to keep up with what is happening in the life of someone I met years ago and with whom I don't feel any connection now!
I dislike the hollow, superficial connections of social media; I’d rather form deeper bonds with people and focus on self-development without obsessing over how I'm seen in the eyes of others.
Also, I deliberately limit what I share online and refuse to contribute to companies with proven unethical behavior where feasible.
That said, I use social media sparingly to connect with academics, follow scholarly discussions, stay informed on topics of interest, message others, and keep track of relevant announcements and events.
That's my social media philosophy in a nutshell.

I removed my Facebook and Instagram accounts years ago, and I never felt like I needed to go back to them!
As Seneca says:
> Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.
I never used Twitter much, but the growth of Fediverse led me to try Mastodon, where I connected with many great academics—even landing an interview!
While I still value Mastodon, I've since joined Bluesky as more researchers migrated there, and now follow most academic discussions on that platform.

I maintain a GitHub profile for programming and collaborative projects.
I created a LinkedIn account solely out of professional necessity, though I've been mostly inactive there.
Unlike Bluesky and Mastodon, the content on LinkedIn often feels shallow by comparison.
It is, however, the first page that shows up in many search engines when someone searches for my name.

I have some other accounts as well, either real or pseudonymous, but I don’t share them publicly since they serve more personal or specialized purposes and don’t need to be listed here.
While this may seem obvious, it's worth noting that any accounts using my name but not linked from this website may not be mine!
