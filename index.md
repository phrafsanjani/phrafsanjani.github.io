# About Me

\toc

## Parsa Hosseinipour Rafsanjani (Parsa H. Rafsanjani)

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciences from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic),
with coursework and research spanning mathematics and computational methods.
During my studies, I was drawn to probability and statistics,
which led me to collaborate with Dr. Adel Mohammadpour on a research manuscript on mathematical statistics and a book on statistical inquiry.
My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics and molecular biology, with a focus on developing and analyzing computational tools for omics data.

Next, I share my academic research focus as well as topics I study independently:

## Formal Research Interests

### Statistics

I am passionate about both theoretical and applied statistics.
My research interests span computational biology, bioinformatics, and statistical applications in psychology, economics, and other social sciences.
At the core of my motivation is my conviction that data and statistical literacy are essential life skills in our modern world.

### Computational Biology and Bioinformatics

Building on probability theory, statistical sciences also provide powerful tools to model and analyze natural phenomena.
My particular interest lies in applying statistical and computational methods to advance research in computational biology and bioinformatics.
To me, meaningful work means seeing how my efforts tangibly help others.
That’s why I want to formally work in the biomedical field—combining my passion for molecular and cell biology with the opportunity to make a real difference.

## Independent Studies

### Philosophy

My primary philosophical interest is Stoicism, particularly the works of Seneca.
However, I also enjoy studying other prominent Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus,
along with more modern thinkers.

In a letter to his friend Lucilius, Seneca proclaims philosophy's universal invitation:
> Philosophy neither rejects anyone nor chooses anyone; it shines
> for all. Socrates was no patrician; Cleanthes hauled water, and hired
> himself out to water people’s gardens; Plato did not come to philosophy
> a nobleman but was ennobled by it. Why should you not hope
> perhaps to become their equal? All of them are your ancestors if you
> prove yourself worthy of them. And you will do so if you persuade
> yourself, right now, that no one is superior to you merely by reason
> of noble birth.
― Lucius Annaeus Seneca, *Letters on Ethics*, Letter 44. Translated by Margaret Graver and A. A. Long. The University of Chicago Press, 2015.

In another letter, he writes:
> Would you like to know what philosophy has to oﬀer the human race? Advice!
― Lucius Annaeus Seneca, *Letters on Ethics*, Letter 48. Translated by Margaret Graver and A. A. Long. The University of Chicago Press, 2015.

### Psychology

My interest in psychology focuses specifically on close relationships, singlehood, and personality. These are concepts I've deeply contemplated in my personal life, and I believe rigorous research in these areas is profoundly important.

### Economics

Economics is another field I occasionally study.
We should all strive to be good decision-makers, and economic literacy is key to this.
Economics isn't just about money and markets—it's a framework for life.
I believe that with economic knowledge, we can make better choices, from everyday decisions to major financial ones.

### Open-Source & GNU/Linux

Beyond academia, I'm a GNU/Linux enthusiast.
I began using GNU/Linux in 2020,
starting with Ubuntu before exploring other distributions like Fedora, Linux Mint, and Pop!\_OS.
After primarily using Pop!_OS for several years, I transitioned to Arch Linux—and have had no major issues with it since.

My main motivation was to deepen my understanding of Linux.
Arch has taught me what questions to ask when configuring my system for my workflow,
and how little is actually needed to perform my computations.
Unlike versioned distributions, Arch follows a rolling-release model (there’s just one Arch Linux, not Arch 1.0, Arch 2.0, etc.),
which I see as one of its greatest strengths.
The system is reliable, and thanks to excellent Arch and Arch-based forums, problems can usually be resolved quickly.

I also appreciate Arch’s philosophy:
it’s entirely free to use without restrictions, and users have full control—whether choosing free or proprietary software.

More broadly, I’m deeply interested in exploring and supporting open-source software and communities.
Whenever possible, I try to minimize reliance on large corporations.
While I don’t oppose using well-made proprietary tools, I actively evaluate tech trends and company practices before deciding what to adopt.

## Social Media and Online Activity

Since being introduced to GNU/Linux and switching to it, I've developed a deep interest in open source and free software, along with privacy and security.
Around that same period, I decided to remove my Instagram and Facebook accounts—years later, I don't miss them at all.
As Seneca says:
> Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.
I never used Twitter much, but the growth of Fediverse led me to try Mastodon, where I connected with many great academics—even landing an interview!
While I still value Mastodon, I've since joined Bluesky as more researchers migrated there, and now follow most academic discussions on that platform.

I also maintain a GitHub profile for programming and collaborative projects.
I only keep LinkedIn due to its professional necessity, though I'm mostly inactive there—unlike Bluesky and Mastodon, the content generally feels shallow in comparison.
Nevertheless, I've been trying to be more active there recently.
It is also the first page that shows up in many search engines when someone searches for my name.

I have accounts on other platforms as well (some real, some pseudonymous),
but I don’t publicly share them here, as they serve more specific purposes.
Therefore, any accounts under my name that aren't linked here may not be mine!
