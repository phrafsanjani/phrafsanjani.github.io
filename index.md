# About Me

\toc

## Parsa Hosseinipour Rafsanjani

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).

**NOTE:** My surname is *Hosseinipour Rafsanjani*.
In Persian, the second part of the surname is usually omitted,
so people call me *Hosseinipour* or simply *Hosseini*.
There are no strict rules, however, and I've been addressed by *Rafsanjani* as well.
Nowadays I go by *Parsa H. Rafsanjani*,
so while *Hosseinipour* is not my middle name,
I treat it as such.

## Research Interests

### Bioinformatics and Computational Biology 

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of statistics and molecular biology,
with a focus on developing and analyzing computational tools for omics data.
Currently, my studies focus on analyzing transcriptomic data and quantification of RNA isoforms.

### Mathematical Statistics

I am also interested in the theory of statistics motivated by real-world applications.
My previous research in this field has been on developing a unified approach for hypothesis testing applied to the exponential family of distributions.

## Social Media and Online Activity

I maintain a GitHub profile for programming and collaborative projects.
I created a LinkedIn account since it seems like every professional has one.
This account is the first page that shows up in many search engines when someone searches for my name,
which besides making and maintaining professional connections is another reason to keep it.

I never used Twitter much, but with the growth of Fediverse,
I joined Mastodon and found many great academics.
However, as my field began adopting Bluesky,
I eventually moved there as well.

My official social media and professional accounts are linked from this website.
Apart from these,
I have some other accounts which I don't share here as they serve more personal purposes.
While this may seem obvious,
it is still worth mentioning that any unlinked accounts under my name
should be treated as unverified and may not be mine.
