# About Me

\toc

## SeyedParsa Hosseinipour Rafsanjani

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciences from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).
My undergrad contained courses on mathematics, computer science and statistics,
both applied and theoretical.
Currently I am doing research in mathematical statistics,
but my prospective field is computational biology and bioinformatics.

**NOTE:** My preferred given name is *Parsa* and my surname is *Hosseinipour Rafsanjani*.
In Persian, the second part of the surname is usually omitted,
so people call me *Hosseinipour* or simply *Hosseini*.
There are no strict rules, however, and I've been addressed by *Rafsanjani* as well.
Nowadays I go by *Parsa H. Rafsanjani*, but *Hosseinipour* is NOT my middle name!

## Research Interests

### Computational Biology and Bioinformatics

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of statistics and molecular biology,
with a focus on developing and analyzing computational tools for omics data.
I am interested in analyzing transcriptomic data and quantification of RNA isoforms.

### Mathematical Statistics

My research journey began with mathematical statistics,
specifically hypothesis testing.
Statistics provides the foundation for data analysis and therefore a lot of sciences,
which has its roots in mathematics.
I find it interesting that such an important field which deals with uncertainty was born out of mathematics, a stronghold of certainty!

## Open-Source and GNU/Linux

Beyond academia, I'm a GNU/Linux enthusiast.
I began using GNU/Linux in 2020,
starting with Ubuntu before moving on to other distributions like Fedora, Linux Mint and Pop!\_OS.
Having used Pop!_OS as my primary OS for several years,
I finally switched to Arch Linux.

My main motivation was to deepen my understanding of Linux.
Arch has taught me what questions to ask when configuring my system for my workflow,
and how little is actually needed to perform my computations.
Unlike versioned distributions, Arch follows a rolling-release model (there’s just one Arch Linux, not Arch 1.0, Arch 2.0, etc.),
which I see as one of its greatest strengths.
The system is reliable, and thanks to excellent Arch and Arch-based forums, problems can usually be resolved quickly.

More broadly, I’m deeply interested in exploring and supporting open-source software and communities.
Whenever possible, I try to minimize my reliance on large corporations.
I'm not against using well-made proprietary tools,
but I evaluate company policies and history before deciding which ones to use.

## Social Media and Online Activity

I generally try to avoid social media.
I have no interest nor any reason to keep up with what is happening in the life of someone I met years ago and with whom I don't feel any connection now!
I dislike the hollow, superficial connections of social media; I’d rather form deeper bonds with people and focus on self-development without obsessing over how I'm seen in the eyes of others.
Also, I deliberately limit what I share online and refuse to contribute to companies with proven unethical behavior as much as I can.
That said, I use social media to connect with academics,
follow scholarly discussions, stay informed on topics of interest,
message others, and keep track of announcements and events I care about.
That's my social media philosophy in a nutshell.

I removed my Facebook and Instagram accounts years ago,
and I never missed anything serious!
As Seneca says,
> Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.
I never used Twitter much, but with the growth of Fediverse,
I created a Mastodon account where I found many great academics (I even landed an interview!).
As for microblogging platforms,
I am now mostly on Bluesky as more researchers migrated there.

I also maintain a GitHub profile for programming and collaborative projects.
I created a LinkedIn account since it seems like every professional has it.
Though, unlike Bluesky and Mastodon,
the content on LinkedIn often feels shallow by comparison,
but after setting "Preferred feed view" to "Most recent posts" from "Account preferences",
I don't get random suggested posts on my feed which makes it a much better experience.
My LinkedIn account is also the first page that shows up in many search engines when someone searches for my name,
which besides making and maintaining professional connections is another reason to keep it.

I have some other accounts as well, either real or pseudonymous,
but I don’t share them publicly since they serve more personal or specialized purposes and don’t need to be listed here.
While this may seem obvious,
it is still worth noting that any accounts under my name but not linked from this website may not be mine!
