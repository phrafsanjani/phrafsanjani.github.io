            We introduce a unified framework for hypothesis testing within the scale-exponential family of distributions,
a continuous family that encompasses many well-known distributions as special cases.
We construct uniformly most powerful tests for simple and one-sided hypotheses.
For two-sided alternatives, where a UMP test does not typically exist, we derive a uniformly most powerful unbiased test.
We also develop a test for the more complex task of testing against a composite interval hypothesis.
The algorithms for these tests are implemented in the R programming language and are applied to a wide range of examples,
demonstrating the framework's utility and comparing its performance across different distributions.
