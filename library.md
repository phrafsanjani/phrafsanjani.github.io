## Books

I have always been an avid reader and a book lover. When I was younger, I primarily enjoyed fiction.
But nowadays, I cannot just read any book or any story. I have become too picky,
and I only opt for the very good stories when it comes to fiction!
Aside from that, most of my reading consists of non-fiction and textbooks,
including books and papers related to my research and other interests as I discussed in [About Me](/) section.

Here, I’ve decided to list my favorite books, and I plan to gradually add my reviews.
You can also check out [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/phrafsanjani), where I try to add other books I’ve read.

I created my first Goodreads account when I was in my early teens,
but I removed it and then created another account before removing it again!
The reason was that my to-read list would become so big it gave me anxiety, and also because Goodreads is owned by Amazon.
But I finally decided to keep one account, given that it is still well-established among readers, so many editions are available for each book, and the UI is comparably better than alternatives.

While I haven’t read every textbook from cover to cover,
I have thoroughly read all the fiction and philosophy titles,
except for [the ones I'm currently reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/193594653-parsa?shelf=currently-reading).

I have looked through many textbooks, and the ones listed here are those I truly enjoyed and found comprehensive enough to build strong fundamentals.
Researchers look through numerous books and papers, but newcomers need a solid foundation to go further.
These days, many lecture notes and course materials are sufficient to build these foundations, and of course, many textbooks grow out of these lecture notes.
However, the books I've listed here are the ones I would read cover to cover if I was learning the material on my own for the first time.
Finding some of these books was random, but it made me very happy since I couldn't find what I was looking for anywhere else, and what a joy it is when you come across a book that finally is THE ONE!

### Probability and Statistics

I hope to get my hands on *The Simple and Infinite Joy of Mathematical Statistics* by J.N. Corcoran
to see if it can replace Hogg's book here, as I think while Corcoran's may not cover as much material as Hogg's,
it focuses on the most important topics and offers greater pedagogical value.
[Her videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLyj1Zd4UWrPZH-fknPLak0tlUpUISBZR) surely attest to that!

### Real Analysis

Aside from the books listed here,
I have a 188-page handwritten set of notes (in Persian) from my undergraduate studies,
mostly based on the first two chapters of *Real Mathematical Analysis* by Charles C. Pugh.
A huge part of these notes cover metric spaces, a topic not included in the two books below (although Tao's *Analysis II* covers it, but I have not checked it out myself).
I may upload these notes or a variation of them at some point.
I have described everything and written every proof with almost all details in my own words,
which I believe is the best approach for proof-based courses such as real analysis.

Real analysis is a foundational field, forming the basis of calculus and, in some programs,
serving as a prerequisite for topology (the contents of real analysis courses vary widely).
It is also a prerequisite for measure theory, which underpins modern probability theory.
With a strong foundation in real analysis, I believe measure-theoretic probability can be learned along the way if needed.
Researchers more oriented toward applied statistics may never need it or may only require a very limited amount.
(I like [this blog post](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2016/12/20/review-of-theoretical-statistics-stat-210a-at-berkeley/) for a more detailed perspective on this matter.)

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7896899298">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is a brief introduction to Stoicism, starting with the core principle of the philosophy (some things are in our control and others not.) While reading Seneca's letters on ethics, I recalled passages from The Enchiridion and made connections between the two. I believe this short handbook serves as an excellent summary of the main Stoic beliefs.<br />The beauty of Stoicism is that it was not just a philosophy for lords or people of high rank; it included wise individuals from various social standings. Epictetus's words are filled with wisdom, just like those of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. Whether slave, senator, or king, they were all great individuals.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7912014193">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
<b>English Review (Persian below)</b><br /><br />I read this book about two years ago, and it is truly one of the best books!<br />It feels as if the book kills the reader once and brings death right before their eyes.<br /><br />It often happens that I ask myself: Am I really on the right path? Will I still think the same years from now about the choices I'm making in my life, which I currently believe are right? How can I know that I won't regret my decisions later? What even is the right choice?<br />Where did Ivan Ilyich go wrong in his life that made death so unacceptable to him? Perhaps he was so absorbed in life that he had completely forgotten about death.<br /><br />One of the important beliefs of the Stoic philosophers is that a human must always remember death. In the works of Seneca, we see that we should live each day as if it were our last, enjoy every day, and not postpone life.<br />A good idea might be to write down our lives up to this point, just as Tolstoy describes Ivan's life. Then we can see if we end up like Ivan, would we truly be satisfied with the life we've lived so far?<br /><br />Ivan enjoyed his life, but not his death. I hope we can live so well that our end is also enjoyable.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to mention this part from Seneca's fourth moral letter to Lucilius (translated by Margaret Graver and A. A. Long), which I believe is very relevant to the book's ending:<br /><blockquote>No evil is great if it is an ending. Death is on its way to you. You would have reason to fear it if it could ever be present with you; necessarily, though, it either does not arrive or is over and gone.</blockquote><br />And similarly, this quote from Epictetus:<br /><blockquote>Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not.</blockquote><br /><br /><b>Persian Review</b><br /><br /><p style="direction:rtl;">این کتاب رو حدود دو سال پیش خوندم و حقیقتاً یکی از اون بهترین کتابهاست!<br />طوریه که انگار آدم رو واقعاً یک بار میکشه و مرگ رو جلو چشمای خواننده میاره. خیلی وقتها پیش میاد که از خودم میپرسم آیا واقعاً دارم راه درست رو میرم؟ آیا انتخابهایی که تو زندگیم میکنم و الان فکر میکنم درسته سالها بعد هم درموردشون همین فکر رو خواهم کرد؟<br />آخه از کجا بدونم که بعدها پشیمون نمیشم از تصمیمم؟ اصلاً انتخاب درست چیه؟<br />ایوان ایلیچ کجای زندگیش رو اشتباه کرد که اینقدر مرگ براش غیرقابل قبول بود؟ شاید چون خیلی سرش به زندگی گرم بوده کلاً مرگ رو فراموش کرده بود.<br />یکی از عقاید مهم فیلسوفان رواقی اینه که انسان باید مرگ رو همیشه به یاد داشته باشه. در آثار سنکا میبینیم که باید طوری زندگی کنیم که انگار هر روز روز آخره، از هر روز لذت ببریم و زندگی رو عقب نندازیم.<br />یه ایده خوب شاید این باشه که بیایم زندگیمون رو تا اینجا بنویسیم، همون طور که تولستوی زندگی ایوان رو شرح میده. بعد ببینیم اگر در ادامه مثل ایوان شدیم، آیا واقعاً راضی هستیم از زندگی که تا اینجا کردیم؟<br />ایوان از زندگی خود لذت برد، اما از مرگ خود نه. ای کاش بتونیم اونقدر خوب زندگی کنیم که پایانمون هم لذت‌بخش باشه.<br />در پایان دوست دارم قسمتی از نامه چهارم اخلاقی سنکا به لوسیلیوس (با ترجمه Margaret Graver و A. A. Long) رو هم بنویسم که به نظرم خیلی مرتبط با پایان کتاب هست:</p><blockquote>No evil is great if it is an ending. Death is on its way to you. You would have reason to fear it if it could ever be present with you; necessarily, though, it either does not arrive or is over and gone.</blockquote><p style="direction:rtl;">و به طور مشابه، این نقل قول از اپیکتتوس:</p><blockquote>Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not.</blockquote>

## Movies and TV Series

You can find a list of movies and miniseries I've watched on [my Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/phrafsanjani/),
although I currently don't write reviews for screen media and just star them.
Unlike books, movies and TV series are my way of escapism and simply enjoying the experience.
